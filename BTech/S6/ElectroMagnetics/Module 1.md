# Module 1 

- If $\overrightarrow A . \overrightarrow B = 0$ then $\overrightarrow A$ and $\overrightarrow B$ are said to be `Orthogonal` or `perpenticular`

- [[DEL Operator]]



### Gauss Divergence Theorem
- It can be used to see the location of `source` and `sink`
- It explains rate of change of function with respect to position
- It is a flux density, it explains how much flux is entering or leaving the source or sink

> [!INFO] Source and Sink
> ***Source*** : A source is a ==component or device that provides power to a circuit==. This could be a battery, a power supply, or any other device that generates electrical energy. In a circuit, the source is where the electrical energy begins its journey. It is the ==starting point for the flow of current==.
>
> ***Sink*** : A sink is a ==component or device that consumes power from a circuit==
 
#statement
$$
\oint P.dS = \oint \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P \ dV 
$$

> [!NOTE] Relation
> *surface intetegral of that function is = volume intetegral of Divergence of that function* 
> So it explains the relationship between surface intetegral and volume intetegral
