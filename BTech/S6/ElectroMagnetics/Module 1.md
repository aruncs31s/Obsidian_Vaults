- If $\overrightarrow A . \overrightarrow B = 0$ then $\overrightarrow A$ and $\overrightarrow B$ are said to be `Orthogonal` or `perpenticular`

#### Electric Fields

#### Electric Flux
The electric flux through an area is defined as the number of electric field lines passing through that area normally.

If the electric field at a certain point be $\overrightarrow E$

Then, the electric flux through an infinitesimal area with an area vector $\overrightarrow{dS}$ around that point will be given by:

$d \phi = \overrightarrow E . \overrightarrow dS$

**Electric Field Intensity**

The electric field intensity at a point in an electric field is the electric force experienced by a unit positive point charge located at that particular point.

**Electric Flux Density**

Electric flux density is the electric flux passing through a unit area normal to the direction of the flux.

**Relation between Electric Field Intensity and Electric Flux Density**

The electric flux density (D→) is equal to the electric field intensity (E→) multiplied by the permittivity (ε) of the medium concerned.

This, we write:

D→=εE→.

The electric field intensity at a distance r from a point charge

E→=14πε⋅qr2 r^.

The electric flux density at the same point will be given by:

D→=εE→D→=ε×14πε⋅qr2 r^D→=q4πr2 r^

### Gauss Divergence Theorem
- It can be used to see the location of `source` and `sink`
- It explains rate of change of function with respect to position
- It is a flux density, it explains how much flux is entering or leaving the source or sink

> [!INFO] Source and Sink
> ***Source*** : A source is a ==component or device that provides power to a circuit==. This could be a battery, a power supply, or any other device that generates electrical energy. In a circuit, the source is where the electrical energy begins its journey. It is the ==starting point for the flow of current==.
>
> ***Sink*** : A sink is a ==component or device that consumes power from a circuit==
 
#statement
$$
\oint P.dS = \oint \overrightarrow \nabla . \overrightarrow P \ dV 
$$

> [!NOTE] Relation
> *surface intetegral of that function is = volume intetegral of Divergence of that function* 
> So it explains the relationship between surface intetegral and volume intetegral
