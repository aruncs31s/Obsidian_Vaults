#pins
- **Serial Data (SDA) –** Transfer of data takes place through this pin.  
- **Serial Clock (SCL) –** It carries the clock signal.

#modes
- Master mode
- Slave mode


#working
1. **Start Condition** – 1 bit
2. **Slave Address** – 8 bit
3. **Acknowledge** – 1 bit

- *data line can not change when the clock line is high, it can change only when the clock line is low*
- *It uses only 2 bi-directional open-drain lines for data communication called SDA and SCL. Both these lines are pulled high*

1. START and STOP can be generated by keeping the SCL line high and changing the level of SDA.
	- START condition the SDA is changed from high to low while keeping the SCL high.
	- STOP condition SDA goes from low to high while keeping the SCL high

2. **Address Frame:** A 7 or 10 bit sequence unique to each slave that identifies the slave when the master wants to talk to it.
3. **Read/Write Bit:** A single bit specifying whether the master is sending data to the slave (low voltage level) or requesting data from it (high voltage level).
```c
requesting data from it (high voltage level)
sending data to the slave (low voltage level)
```
1. **ACK/NACK Bit:** Each frame in a message is followed by an acknowledge/no-acknowledge bit. If an address frame or data frame was successfully received, an ACK bit is returned to the sender from the receiving device

#disadvantages
- Half Duplex
