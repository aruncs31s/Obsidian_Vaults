#### Embedded System
- [Defenition](Defenition)


##### Defenition
*It an Electro-mechanical which is a combination of software and hardware design(working together) to do a specific task*
*It is any device that includes a programmable computer but is not itself intended to be a general-purpose computer. Thus, a PC is not itself an embedded computing system, although PCs are often used to build embedded computing systems. But a fax machine or a clock built from a microprocessor is an embedded computing system.*
