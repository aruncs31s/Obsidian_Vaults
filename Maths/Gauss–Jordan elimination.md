*Gauss–Jordan elimination is a systematic procedure for solving systems of linear equations using row operations*

- Consider the following equations
	- $a \times x + b \times y = c$ and -> (1)
	- $d \times x + e \times y = f$ -> (2)
- If we add α-times the first equation to the second equation, we obtain
an equivalent system of equations
- And then the equations will become
	- $(d + \alpha \times a)x + (e + \alpha \times b)y = f  + \alpha \times c$

*Row operations change the coefficients of the system of equations, but leave the solution unchanged*
