# Neffex Life

Yeah, yeah, let's go
I ain't the first with the curse, with the thirst
That I wanna be better, not worse, man, it hurts
I'm on this earth with my words
And I put 'em all together, insert, 'cause I wanna have worth
Working hella hard, 'til they put me in the dirt
Gonna go far, man, listen to my words
Gonna be a star, man, life's like a blur
When you're working this hard, yeah, you get what you deserve (let's go)
Yeah, I ain't taking a back seat
I'm passing anybody else who is rapping
I'm nasty, ain't nobody able to catch me
They gasping, they cannot compare, they can't match me
I'm at half speed, I got your girl and she laughing
And dancing, hanging on my what? She asking to crash with me
Smash with me, she savagely
Wants cash money, and she knows that I live lavishly, uh
I wanna live
I'm cold inside
Give all I have
Just to feel alive
I fight to live
I fight to strive
One day I'll have
What I want in life
I want the whole world in the palm of my hand, I got a plan
I'm the man, now I'm teaching the game, a veteran, better than
Anybody else who test me
I'm ready, looking at my hand, and it's steady
I'm trending, ascending and blending
Lyrical bending, now I'm spreading and getting
My name out now, yeah, they hearing me loud
All the crowds rapping the sound, I'm hitting the ground
Running, up and coming, ain't nothing, yeah
Rookie of the year, I'ma keep it one hundred
Cold-blooded, no budget, from nothing
To something, nah, I ain't bluffing
I got a full hand and a full plan
I ain't gonna stop 'til I'm at the top, man
Every single drop got me feeling awesome
I'm about to pop, started from the bottom, yeah
I wanna live
I'm cold inside
Give all I have
Just to feel alive
I fight to live
I fight to strive
One day I'll have
What I want in life
