# Neffex Hope

And when you feel like you're nothing  
But you wanna be something  
Yeah  
Well, all you really need is hope  
I just want you to trust me  
If you wanna be something  
Yeah, that's right, let's go, yeah  
Then all you really need is hope

When you're feeling down and you're out  
Like you got nothing but doubt  
You're alone in a crowd  
Just trying to figure it out  
All of this clout  
And the money got you feelin' left out  
Listen up to me now  
Every word that's out of my mouth

Wake up, it's me  
You're gonna follow your dreams  
Or ==are you just gonna be==  
==Another cog in the scene==  
You feel the hope in this beat  
Yeah, the hope that you need  
To proceed and be exactly what you wanted to be

I feel right and I'm proud  
Hype and I'm loud  
I'mma shout all about  
How I feel in the now  
Ain't nobody every gonna try to change me  
'Til I'm I'm dead, pushing up daisies

I'm alone in the crowd  
I won't feel down  
I got hope right now  
And I know I'll be found  
I don't really care just what all of the haters gotta say  
I know everything I do is gonna make 'em fade away, yeah

And when you feel like you'e nothing  
But you wanna be something  
Yeah  
Well, all you really need is hope  
I just want you to trust me  
If you wanna be something  
Yeah (yeah)  
Then all you really need is hope

Yo, take a look in the mirror  
Are you seeing some fear?  
You hear the voice in your ear  
Can you start to see clear  
Are the bad thoughts near?  
Or can you be where your feet are  
Yeah, when you stand right here and say no

I'm never gonna give up  
I'm never gonna slow  
The one that doesn't give up  
Never loses to a foe  
The one that can show  
To myself I can go  
All the way to the top  
Can't stop me no

I'ma soldier, always closer 'til it's over  
Older but I'm bolder moving forward  
Motor, never slower, good to know ya  
Don't go make me drop my shoulder

==You need to believe==  
==You can achieve==  
==Everything that you dream==  
==Everything that you need==  
==Is in the air that you breathe==  
==Is in the mind that you feed==  
==Is in the time that you bleed==  
Every second alive  
Is another blessing to me

And when you feel like you're nothing  
But you wanna be something, yeah  
Well, all you really need is hope  
I just want you to trust me  
If you wanna be something  
Yeah (yeah, let's go, yeah)  
Then all you really need is hope

It's what you need when your down  
Need when you're out  
What you need when your sad  
And when you feel left out  
You feel an energy drought  
And in creeps doubt  
But with a little bit of hope  
You can figure it out  
Keep your head high  
Even when your down inside  
Through the pain you fight  
And through the painful nights  
You keep striving  
Keep trying  
Keep driving  
Rising  
Keep thriving  
Surviving  
Nothings in your way but yourself  
Don't need nobody's help  
You can make it through this hell  
Take it one step at a time  
One step as you climb  
If you fail you'll be fine  
Get back up to the grind  
And never lose sight of your mission  
Be driven  
==This live is a prison==  
==If you don't have a vision==  
Your in it to win it  
So get it, don't miss it  
Your chance is now  
To be something somehow  
Don't let yourself down

That's right  
Sometimes all we really need is hope
