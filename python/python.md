#### Zip

- [Iterating over the zip objects](#iterating%20over%20the%20zip%20objects)

```python
print(zip(weights, biases))
# <zip object at 0x7a2c4d5b3240>
```
- The zip() function adds i_th element at the end of the i_th element of weights
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3] 
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'] 
zipped = zip(list1, list2) 
# You can iterate over the zip object to see its contents 
for item in zipped: print(item)
'''output
(1, 'a') (2, 'b') (3, 'c')
'''
```

###### Iterating over the zip objects


```python
for item in zip(weights,biases):
	print(item)
'''
	([2, 4, 5], 2) ([3, 4, 5], -1) ([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], -2)
	'''
```
- Or convert it to a list to see its contents explicitly
```python
print(list(zip(weights, biases)))
'''
[([2, 4, 5], 2), ([3, 4, 5], -1), ([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], -2)]
'''

```
- without `list` the code wont work
	- - In Python 3, `zip(weights, biases)` returns an iterator that aggregates elements from the `weights` list and the `biases` list in tuples

#### List

- [Shapes](#shapes)

#### List

- [Example](#list%20example)
- [Finding The length](#finding%20the%20length)

*Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.*
###### List Example
```python
someList = [1,2,3]
print(someList)
```
######  Finding the length
```python
print(len(someList))
```
##### Shapes

| Name In python       | Name of the shape | Dimension | Type   | Eg                           | Shape   |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| List                 | Array             | 1         | Vector | [1,2,4,5]                    | 4       |
| List of List(lol)    | Matrix            | 2         | Vector | \[[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5\]]      | (2,4)   |
| List of List of List | Matrix            | 3         | Vector | [Lists](/python/python#list) | (1,3,3) |

> [!NOTE] List of List
> List is a List where its element itself is a list or a group of list 
> Used to represent
> - Tabular Data
> - Matrices etc..


> [!NOTE] List of List of List
> List of List of List is a list where its element itself is a list and the element also contains a list of some type



```python

a_3D_list = [
    [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [1, 2, 3],
        [1, 3, 4],
    ],
    [
        [3, 4, 5],
        [4, 5, 6],
        [5, 6, 6],
    ],
]
print(a_3D_list[0][0][2])
# 3
```
- In the above example the first index corresponds to the 1 element in the outermost list that is consider this example an_lol\[i]\[j\]\[k]
	- ==i== = index of outer most list
	- ==j== = index of the column of the selected list
	- ==k== = index
